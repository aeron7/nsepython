## Versions

There are two versions of NSEPython depending on the execution environment. While it's technically feasible to combine these versions into a single program, doing so could introduce latency. Given the financial nature of this program, time is of the essence.


| NSEPython Edition          | Compatibility                | Tested Environments           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| [Local Edition](https://github.com/aeron7/nsepython)    | Laptops (Windows 9, 10)     | Windows 9, Windows 10         |
| [Server Edition](https://github.com/aeron7/nsepythonserver)   | Servers (AWS, Google Colab, DigitalOcean) | AWS, Google Colab, DigitalOcean |

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pypi.org/project/nsepython/) to install nsepython.

#### [NSEPython Local Edition](https://github.com/aeron7/nsepython)

Access NSEPython for laptops, specifically tailored for Windows 9 and Windows 10 compatibility.


```bash
pip install nsepython
