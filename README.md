## Support and Beta Functions

- If you have other doubts or want to check out the beta functions, visit the [NSEPython Discussions](https://forum.unofficed.com/c/programming/nse-python-api/) forum.
- If you have feature requests, you can submit them at the [NSEPython Feature Request](https://forum.unofficed.com/t/nsepython-discussion-and-feature-request/665) forum.

## Versions

There are two versions of NSEPython depending on the execution environment. While it's technically feasible to combine these versions into a single program, doing so could introduce latency. Given the financial nature of this program, time is of the essence.


| NSEPython Edition          | Compatibility                | Tested Environments           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| [Local Edition](https://github.com/aeron7/nsepython)    | Laptops (Windows 9, 10)     | Windows 9, Windows 10         |
| [Server Edition](https://github.com/aeron7/nsepythonserver)   | Servers (AWS, Google Colab, DigitalOcean) | AWS, Google Colab, DigitalOcean |

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pypi.org/project/nsepython/) to install nsepython.

#### [NSEPython Local Edition](https://github.com/aeron7/nsepython)

Access NSEPython for laptops, specifically tailored for Windows 9 and Windows 10 compatibility.


```bash
pip install nsepython
```

#### [NSEPython Server Edition](https://github.com/aeron7/nsepythonserver)

Leverage NSEPython designed for server environments, seamlessly functioning on AWS, Google Colab, and DigitalOcean.

```bash
pip install nsepythonserver
```

## Cross Library Migration
All the functions from the two renowned packages, NsepY and NSETools, have been migrated here with the same function names. Both of these packages had been left unmaintained for a considerable period.
